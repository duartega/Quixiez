# Quixiez Overview

This is a website that I co-created to help people order things for delivery via text. The web aspect of it was a company user. They had a dashboard and were able to recieve texts and send texts out via sockets as well as edit customer information, edit business information, and personal login information. There was authentication for login as well as using redux/local storage for keeping the session active. The messaging portion was designed similar to what you would see on iPhone messages. The dashboard was the only thing that was non-functional as we did not have time to finish this project.
